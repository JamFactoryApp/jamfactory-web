## What is JamFactory

JamFactory is a collaborative playback controller. A JamSession is a private party with **one** host to set it up, and many attendees to join in.

Your friends or party guests can vote for the songs they like and want to listen to, and the song with the most votes gets played next.
JamFactory acts as the conductor of your music and is not the playback device itself. Therefore, you are free to **choose your own playback device**.

The host of a JamSession has to have a Spotify premium account, the guests can join the without a Spotify account.

JamFactory consists of independent applications that form the ecosystem together. This project contains the web frontend that allows a user to create, join and manage a JamSession
